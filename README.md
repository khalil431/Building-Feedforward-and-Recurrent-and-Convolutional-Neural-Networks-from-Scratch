# Building Feedforward, Recurrent, and Convolutional Neural Networks from Scratch

This is a project where I programmed neural networks and recurrent neural networks from scratch. The regular feedforward neural networks were trained to predict the gender of a person based on their weight and height, while the recurrent neural network was trained for sentiment analysis by predicting whether a sentence is positive or negative.

Step-by-step instructions on how to get the development environment running.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git

# Change into the project directory
cd Building-Feedforward-and-Recurrent-and-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-from-Scratch
```

## Usage

If you wish to run the feedforward neural network:

```bash
# Change into FNN directory
cd FNN
python fnn.py
```

If you wish to run the recurrent neural network:

```bash
# Change into RNN directory
cd RNN
python main.py
```

If you wish to run the convolutional neural network:

```bash
# Change into CNN directory
cd CNN
python cnn.py
```
