This is a project where I programmed neural networks and recurrent neural networks from scratch. The regular feedforward neural networks were trained to predict the gender of a person based on their weight and height, while the recurrent neural network was trained for sentiment analysis by predicting whether a sentence is positive or negative. Run fnn.py using "py fnn.py" to run the regular feedforward neural network and run main.py using "py main.py" to test the recurrent neural network. This is just a personal project, with all credit attributed to https://victorzhou.com/series/neural-networks-from-scratch/.
