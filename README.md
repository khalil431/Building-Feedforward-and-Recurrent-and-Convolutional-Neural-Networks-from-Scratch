# Building Feedforward, Recurrent, and Convolutional Neural Networks from Scratch

This personal project involves programming feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks from scratch. The regular feedforward neural network was trained to predict the gender of a person based on their weight and height, the recurrent neural network was trained for sentiment analysis by predicting whether a sentence is positive or negative, and the convolutional neural network was trained to solve the MNIST handwritten digit classification problem.
